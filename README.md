### Minesweeper as you know it, but in 3D (and in outer space)!

_"Modern" Minesweeper created by Robert Donner and Curtis Johnson._

#### Features

*   4 different themes
*   8 different cube grid sizes
*   4 levels of difficulty
*   "Cheat Mode" - reveals all mines from the start. Â Great for learning the game!

#### Instructions

Goal: Remove all non-mine cubes.

Click on a cube with a mine inside and it's game over.

Click on a non-mine cube to possibly get a number \[1-26\], which reveals how many surrounding mine cubes it is touching (including immediate diagonals and in the layers immediately above and below).

Use "Cheat Mode" in the game to better understand how this numbering system works.
